# Versioning in Node.js

Versioning is like giving a name to different versions of software. It helps us keep track of changes and updates. Just like how you have different versions of your favorite video game, software also has different versions.

## What is a version?

A version is a special name given to a specific release of software. It's like a secret code that tells us which version of the software we are using. Imagine you have a toy robot, and you give it a name like "Robot Version 1.0". This name tells you that it's the first version of the robot.

## Semantic Versioning

In Node.js, we use a special way of naming versions called "Semantic Versioning" or "SemVer" for short. It's like a set of rules that everyone follows when naming versions. It helps us understand what changes are included in each version.

According to SemVer, the version number has three parts: major, minor, and patch. It's like a secret code with three numbers separated by dots. Let's say we have a version number like "1.2.3". Here's what each number means:

- The first number (1) is the major version. It tells us that there are big changes or new features in this version. It's like a big upgrade for the software.
- The second number (2) is the minor version. It includes smaller updates and new features that work with the previous version. It's like adding new toys to your robot without changing its basic functions.
- The third number (3) is the patch version. It includes bug fixes and small updates that don't change anything major. It's like fixing small problems in your robot.

## Using Versions in Node.js

In Node.js, we can specify the version of Node.js runtime and packages in a special file called `package.json`. This file is like a blueprint for our project and contains important information about it.

To specify the Node.js version, we use the `engines` field in `package.json`. It's like telling our project which version of Node.js it should use. For example, we can say "Hey project, use Node.js version 12.16.1".

## Example

### 4.6.1

### 1st part -> 4
### 2nd part -> 6
### 3rd part -> 1

### 3rd part - Minor Fixes (Optional)

### 2nd part - Recommeneded Bug Fix (Security Bug, creating a new feature etc)

### 1st part - Major Release (Breaking Update, entire new version)

In the example above, you can see an example of how we specify the Node.js version in `package.json`. It's like writing a special note for our project.

Remember, versioning is like giving names to different versions of software. It helps us keep track of changes and understand what each version includes. Just like how you have different versions of your favorite video game, software also has different versions.
